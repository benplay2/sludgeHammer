Sludgehammer the AWESOME python-based game

Check out the trailer on YouTube: https://youtu.be/3f29E0HL2yc

Created in 2011, Sludgehammer is a simple text-based game written in Python. This game is a product of my free time at college and having fun with my friends.

You can either run the source file with Python, or if you have a windows machine, run an executable.

In order to move, you must type W, A, S, or D and press enter. This aspect could definitely be improved upon in the future.
